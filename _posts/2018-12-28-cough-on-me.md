总结一下：

- 尽量少接触,勤洗手 Keep your distance, limit handshaking
- 打流感疫苗（国内似乎不流行） get the flu shot 



Picture this: You're on your daily commute to work, fully concentrating on your podcast, when, out of the corner of your eye, you notice someone near you with their face scrunched up, eyes watering, trying their hardest not to cough until they lose the battle and let loose in your general direction. You're not sure if they coughed on you, but with this flu season, you don't want to take any chances. Fortunately, science has some answers on what you should do if someone coughs on you to avoid getting sick.

"We know the flu bug isn’t very resilient once it is outside your body," Lisa Yakas, a microbiologist and Senior Certification Project Manager at NSF International, tells Bustle. "Studies have shown that it generally only lives for a few minutes to a few hours." Therefore, staying out of the way of someone else's cough or sneeze, as well as keeping your hands away from surfaces airborne germs could have come into contact with, is your first line of defense for not contracting an illness. But what else can you do, proactively, to avoid getting sick?

Your number-one thing to do to not get sick, particularly with the flu, is to get your flu shot. If it's available and recommended for you, as it is for the vast majority of people over the age of 18 months, you should get the flu vaccine every year. A 2015 study noted that college students who were popular should be among the first to consider getting a jab, both because they'd influence others, and because they were more likely than introverts to spread flu viruses. Getting a flu vaccine every year is necessary because flu strains differ between seasons, and new antibodies are continually being developed to help refine the medical community's response to the threat of flu. It's also not too late to get your shot, if you haven't yet — the CDC predicts that flu season could go through March of 2018. While flu vaccines aren't completely effective — the CDC emphasizes that this year's vaccine is only around 10 percent effective — it's a necessary addition to your immune system's arsenal to help it get through.
